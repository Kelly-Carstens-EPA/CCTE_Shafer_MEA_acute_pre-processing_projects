Note for next time you save a level 0 snapshot - 
careful when you run remove_dmso_outliers.
If any of the wllq notes change bc the dataset wide mean and SD change - people might not appreciate if wllq's change for no apparent reason, other than added data.
I mean, maybe leave it, but I'm thinking it woudl be better to only update the wllq based on DMSO outliers for the new data sets?
