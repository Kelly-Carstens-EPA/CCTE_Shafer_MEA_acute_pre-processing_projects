# Repo for CCTE_Shafer_MEA_acute pre-processing scripts and output

# Content that is located on the remote on the L drive (`L:\Lab\NHEERL_MEA\Carpenter_Amy\pre-process_mea_acute_for_tcpl`), but is gitignored from the remote repo

All version of the output/ .RData files that were not the latest date (as of Jan 20, 2023)
Using the script `general_checking_functions/programmatically_identify_most_recent_output_rdata_files_2023-01-10.R`

(I should probably delete and/or deprecate these files, but not 100% sure what is safe to delete)
