# Repo for CCTE_Shafer_MEA_acute pre-processing projects

Refer to MEA Acute pre-processing Notes.docx for a brief guide of how to use the scripts in mea-acute-neural-stats-to-mc0-scripts/ to pre-process data from MEA Acute experiments.

The folder `mea-acute-neural-stats-to-mc0-scripts/run_me/` contains the official/final version of the run_me scripts used to process the data for each project. Note that the scripts that these run_me's reference may be updated, so utilize the Git commit history to obtain the version of the scripts under mea-acute-neural-stats-to-mc0-scripts/ that correspond to the run_me for the project of interest.

## Notes

Before the commit on Jan 10, 2023, this repo only contained the scripts under `mea-acute-neural-stats-to-mc0-scripts`. This repo was expanded to include the project folders on Jan 10, 2023.
