## # Purpose ----

## To confirm that the current MEA Acute TCPL sc results are as expected for the LDH and AB endpoints<br>
## Motivation: I noticed that Acetaminophen is a hit in a cyto assay... that didn't seem right. So we shall investigate.<br>
## From Strickland et al, 2018: "Further, changes in MFR occurred in the absence of cytotoxicity, as only 8 compounds decreased cell viability"<br>
## from results section: "Compounds were deemed cytotoxic if they induced greater than 20% increase in LDH release and/or decreased mitochondrial activity by more than 80%"

## # Prepare data ----

# Load tcpl results

## # Check out activity of LDH/AB ----

                         AB_hitc = hitc[grepl('AB',aenm)]), by = .(dsstox_substance_id, chnm, casn)]

## Wait a sec... There are 175 hits in the LDH??

## What were the cutoffs?

## Looks like a 3*bmad cutoff was used<br>
## No wonder there are 175 hits for the LDH - the cutoff is SO low!!

## 
## From results section, Jenna used a 20% cutoff for the LDH (in the up direciton) and 20% for AB (in the dn direction)<br>
## It doesn't look like she published those results, but what if I applied those hit calls?<br>

## So there are 184 samples that are currently a hit for LDH, but probably shoudn't be<br>

## **I'm still slightly confused on where these values came fromâ€¦ (I'm just guessing 80% corresponds to 80% decrease in viability, but I don't actually know how these values were normalized)<br>
## There are no normalization method in TCPL<br>
## I haven't been able to find the srcf (NHEERL_MEA_SS_SOURCE_RAW_DATA_150422.csv), so I haven't been able to do much forensics<br>
## But I think reasonable to assume 80% is applicable to this data?<br>

## So i guess with the factor of needing to fit a curve combined with overall lower response values,
## it looks like the current low cutoffs based on 3*bmad aren't terrible for the MC.
##
## Review meaning of values for the cyto assays, as I prepare d the values for the MC:
##
## LDH_up: raw blank-corrected values that correspond to the amount of LDH released (from dead cells). 
## At level 3, the values are normalized to the LDH released from a well in which all the cells have been lysed.
## So larger resp values indicate more LDH released because there were more dead cells in the well.
## So a cutoff of 20% roughly means that the chemical was 20% as cytotoxic as something that totally destroys cells relative to DMSO.


##
## AB_dn: Raw values corresponds to the amount of mitochondrial activity. So lower values indicate less activity, likely more cells are dead.
## Values are zero-centered and made increasing, so resp = 0% means 100% viability.
## resp = 20% would be an 80% decrease viability.
##

## # Current thoughts:
## - As far as # of hits, the multi-conc current AB and LDH cutoffs look okay. But if we are going to base the sc cutoffs on a percent, it might make sense to do the same for the mc
## - We could use a cutoff of 30% or 3bmad, whichever is higher. That way, the cutoff for the AB in the mc would stay at 3bmad
##
## Other thoughtss:<br>
## We probably should change the coff!!<br>
## Is this thinking correct - we woulnd't expect the DMSO wells to cause much of a response at all, so it doesn't make sense to use the DMSO as the threshold for a biologically significant effect in these assays<br>
## I just confirmed that pc20 is a cutoff option in TCPL.<br>
## Would we want to change the cutoff for the MC methods as well?
