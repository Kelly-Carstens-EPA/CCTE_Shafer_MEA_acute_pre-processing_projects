The file DNTFalseNegatives_dat4_2022-04-28.RData was created on 4/28/2022. This version of the data was used to created the lvl0 data that was ran in tcplLite to generate AC50 estimates for Jankowski et al.'s manuscript on 6PPD.

Some of the srcf's used in run_me_DNTFalseNegatives.R to create DNTFalseNegatives_dat4_2022-04-28.RData were updated in September 2022 (after April 2022). (The only known updates were to convert the conc's in some srcf's from ug/mL to uM for 6-PPD quinone).

Regardless, I am copying over the meta-data srcf used in the creation of the output today as it appears today, April 19, 2023.
