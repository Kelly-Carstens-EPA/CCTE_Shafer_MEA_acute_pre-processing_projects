In dat3, impedance data at 72h(taken at the same timepoint with LDH and CTB) are combined with cytodat and later combined with neural data
CTB, LDH and IMP data can be compared (all three different assays at the same timpoint)

In imp_dat, there is baseline and treated(all timepoint) data available.
Can plot graphs looking at each compound at each concentration over time. (ignore/take into account of the baseline)

In imp_AUC, AUC calculated using treated(9 timepoints)
I did this to mimic whatever that is done for NFA

*data is kinda patchy, some endpoints does not have same number of replicates, due to dosing error and switching compound(Picro to Tween 20), and different timepoint collection for cytotoxicity data
