# looks like media wells really do just contain Media
# actually makes some sense based on the assay - 
# first, 50uL of culture Media from each well in MEA plate is transfered to LDH plate (so F1 just contains Media in LDH plate)
# then 20uL of Media is added to F1 in the MEA plate. Then (all?) of the contents are removed and mixed
# a Media/Alamar Blue mixture is added to eadch well of MEA plate
# then culture Media/Blue mixutre is taken from MEA plates to CTB plates
# all this to say, I understand now why the 
# The only time when well F1 would have Lysis in the LDH assay is the same time when Lysis is added before the second recording,
# which was already clearly marked in the Group 1 file. 
# So LDH well treatments should usually = neural stats well treatments, if Lysis, PICRO, etc. were added before the second recording
